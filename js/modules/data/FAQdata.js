        "content": "<p>Relax, we’re here to help so please get in touch!</p><p>To make it easier for us to recommend you the right product, please provide us with a little information. What’s your budget, what are you going to be using the headphones for (portable, home use or a bit of both), what is your source (portable mp3 player, home cd player, computer etc), what kind of music do you listen to and if there’s any particular style of sound you prefer (energetic, warm etc – don’t worry about this if you’re not sure). Please don’t tell us you just want your headphones to be loud and bassy!</p>"

        "heading": "What do the product measurements mean?",
        "content": "<p>Generally it’s a good idea to ignore most of the specifications listed with headphones. It may sound a little unusual and you might consider it hard to choose headphones without something to go by, but the only product information that really matters are details like whether the headphones are circumaural or supra-aural, whether they’re open or closed, how heavy they are, how long the cable is (or range if they’re wireless) what kind of earpads they have and perhaps impedance/efficiency.</p><p>It’s a common misconception that the wider the frequency response the better the headphones will sound. Unfortunately this is a long way from the truth, it also makes choosing products more difficult as some models have the exact same frequency response yet sound completely different. For example one headphone may quote a frequency response of 5-32000Hz while another quotes 5-35000Hz. From this measurement you could assume that both have low bass but one has more high end. In reality the two headphones could sound nothing alike.</p><p>Why is this? Because a frequency range only tells you theoretical maximum and minimums, it doesn’t tell you how even that response is. Coupled with that the range of human hearing is only 20-20000Hz, and most source equipment isn’t even capable of reproducing those ranges (certainly not most basic portable players or PC soundcards).</p><p>One technical measurement that may help is impedance. Generally the higher the impedance the harder the headphones are to drive, however there are some high impedance headphones that are very efficient and some low impedance headphones that are very inefficient so keep an eye on the efficiency as high efficiency means they may be easier to drive.</p>"

        "heading": "So, in other words, better frequency response doesn't mean better sound?",
        "content": "<p>No, not at all. 5Hz may seem like an impressive low, but it doesn’t mean it’s going to be a “bassier” headphone than one that only manages 20Hz and just because they quote down to 5Hz and/or up to 50,000Hz that doesn’t mean you’ll like the sound more.</p>"

    {
        "heading": "What's the difference between open and closed headphones?",
        "content": "<p>Open headphones generally have a design that leaves the entire, or some of the back of the headphones open (covered by a protective grille of some sorts). This allows for a more natural and wider sound from the headphones. It’s normal for open headphones to sound better than similarly priced closed headphones. Closed headphones often have a more “in your head” sound and sound a little boxed in. The main benefit with closed headphones is that they offer isolation from outside noise and generally don’t leak sound, making closed headphones more appropriate for people who don’t want outside noise interfering with their music or don’t want to disturb people around them. If you have the choice, we recommend open headphones, but for portable use closed is probably a better choice!</p>"

        "heading": "What's the difference between circumaural, supra aural and intra aural?",
        "content": "<p>Circumaural means the earpads go around your ears, supra-aural means the earpads sit on your ears, intra aural means the headphones go in your ears (earbuds and canalphones). Generally circumaural headphones are more comfortable, but that also depends on the type of earpads they use and how strong the clamping force. There are some supra-aural (on ear) headphones that are very comfortable as well.</p>"

        "heading": "What is burn in?",
        "content": "<p>Some believe that headphones should be burnt-in to get the best sound out of them. There is no proper or best way to do this, and it’s debatable whether it has any effect at all. Just using the headphones will have the same effect, but if you want to hear what your headphones are capable of without waiting we suggest leaving them running overnight at a reasonably high volume (nothing higher than you’d normally listen to). It is generally not a good idea to play sine sweeps or similar through the headphones as it can damage them. The main thing to remember is that this does not have to be done.</p>"

        "heading": "What's so good about headphones anyway?",
        "content": "<p>Value for money; It doesn’t cost a lot to get a truly amazing sounding headphone setup, but it can cost a lot to get a truly amazing sounding speaker setup. Personal listening; What do your neighbors think of that big sound system of yours late at night? What about your other housemates/wife/husband/brother/sister/parents/pets? Don’t want to put up with their interruptions? Put a pair of (closed) headphones on! They won’t be disturbed by your music and you won’t be able to hear them. The perfect solution.</p>"

        "heading": "What's a headphone amplifier?",
        "content": "<p>Some headphones are designed to run from home hifi systems with a little more power than your average portable player or PC soundcard. Unfortunately there many hifi products which while being excellent at their primary function have a mere $2 put into the headphone circuit.</p><p>A headphone amplifier is designed to drive and power headphones and headphones alone. Under driving headphones will leave them sounding flat and lacking dynamics. In many cases an underpowered pair of high end headphones will be outperformed by easier to drive low end headphones unless paired with the right amplifier.</p>"

        "heading": "How load do headphones go?",
        "content": "<p>When properly driven most headphones will manage levels high enough to cause hearing damage. Now listen up people, hearing damage is permanent – you don’t want hearing damage. Don’t crank your headphones up to extra-high volumes because later in life when you’re lying in bed listening to the ringing in your ears caused by all that abuse you’ll wish you hadn’t done it. It’s also easy to train your ears to be used to listening at low volumes, we highly recommend it. If you’d like to measure you equipment most electronic stores have SPL meters available at affordable prices.</p>"

        "heading": "How come i haven't heard of some of this brands?",
        "content": "<p>In the world of audio some brands stick to what they know best. Unlike mass consumer brands you won’t see ads on TV for the likes of Beyerdynamic, Alessandro or Etymotic. This is because they don’t need to advertise. If you go into a professional studio or TV station you’ll see Beyerdynamic, AKG and Sennheiser products all over the place. Just because you haven’t heard of them, it doesn’t mean a brand that spends millions more on marketing has a better product.</p>"
